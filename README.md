When to stop an iterative image reconstruction? Especially when only a single noisy image has been recoreded.

In general this depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and on the underlying (unkown) object itself. What often happens with iterative image reconstruction is, that the

For example: lets suppose we want to deconvolve a noisy image using the Richardson-Lucy algorithm ([I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com))
In general this depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and on the underlying (unknown) object itself.
