# Binomial-splitting
Employ binomial splitting to create two stochastically independent images from a single measure image.

Disclaimer!
The presented idea is based on thoughts of Andrew York (@AndrewGYork; andrew.g.york+github@gmail.com) who gratefully shared this with me.

When to stop an iterative image reconstruction? Especially when only a single noisy image has been recoreded.
